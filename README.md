The Password Manager is a Flask-based web app that stores and manaegs login credentials. I chose to create the app in flask as i wanted to extend my pyton skills, whilst brushing up on basic html and css. For the python application, i followed an object orientated desgin approach.

Functionality: The app utilises python, html, css and javascript The app includes user authentication, a dashboard for viewing and adding sites, and data storage using json files

Fututre changes: The app in its current state is unfinished, in future i will add encryption functionality to securely store the passwords in a json file. After implementing encryption, I want to give the app a modern look, with customisation options for users, (dark mode, profile picture ect, user selection screen)
